## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Report Bugs

Found a bug? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/scheilch/spec-kit-devflows/issues/new) with:

- **Clear title**: "Bug: workflow_name - brief description"
- **Steps to reproduce**: Exact commands and context
- **Expected behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happens
- **Environment**:
  - spec-kit version
  - AI agent (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)
  - OS and version

**Example**:
```markdown
## Bug: /modify fails when parent feature has spaces in name

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create feature: /specify "user profile"
2. Try to modify: /modify 001 "add avatar"

### Expected
Creates branch: 001-mod-001-add-avatar

### Actual
Error: "Feature directory not found"

### Environment
- spec-kit: v0.0.30
- AI agent: (name and version)
- macOS: 14.1
```

### 2. Request Features

Have an idea for a new workflow or improvement? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/scheilch/spec-kit-devflows/discussions/new?category=ideas) with:

- **Use case**: What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution**: How would it work?
- **Alternative**: What do people do today without this?
- **Impact**: How many projects would benefit?

**Example**:
```markdown
## New Workflow: /security-audit

### Use Case
Need systematic approach for security reviews before releases.

### Proposed Solution
- Checklist-based workflow
- Automated security scanning integration
- Sign-off tracking

### Current Alternative
Ad-hoc security reviews, often skipped under pressure.

### Impact
Every production deployment should have this.
```

### 3. Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- Fix typos or unclear instructions
- Add examples from your projects
- Improve installation guides
- Translate documentation
- Add troubleshooting tips

**Small fixes**: Open PR directly
**Large changes**: Open issue first to discuss approach

### 4. Share Real-World Examples

Using these workflows in production? Share your experience!

1. [Start a discussion](https://github.com/scheilch/spec-kit-devflows/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell)
2. Include:
   - What workflow you used
   - What problem it solved
   - Metrics (time saved, bugs prevented, etc.)
   - Lessons learned

We may feature your example in [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)!

### 5. Contribute Code

#### Small Fixes

For typos, small bugs, or minor improvements:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/description`
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit PR with clear description

#### New Workflows

Want to contribute a new workflow (e.g., `/performance-audit`, `/security-review`)?

**Before writing code**:

1. [Open a discussion](https://github.com/scheilch/spec-kit-devflows/discussions/new?category=ideas) proposing the workflow
2. Get feedback from maintainers
3. Wait for approval before starting implementation

**After approval**:

1. Follow the [Extension Development Guide](extensions/DEVELOPMENT.md)
2. Create:
   - Workflow template files
   - Bash creation script
   - Command definition
   - Tasks template
   - README for the workflow
3. Test on real project
4. Submit PR with examples

#### Workflow Improvements

Improving existing workflows:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/scheilch/spec-kit-devflows/issues/new) describing the improvement
2. Explain why it's better than current approach
3. Share examples where current approach falls short
4. Wait for maintainer feedback
5. Submit PR

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Bash (Linux, macOS, or WSL2 on Windows)
- A test project with spec-kit installed

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/spec-kit-devflows.git
cd spec-kit-devflows

# 2. Create a test project
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git test-project
cd test-project
specify init .

# 3. Install your local extensions
cp -r ~/spec-kit-devflows/extensions/* .specify/extensions/
cp ~/spec-kit-devflows/scripts/* .specify/scripts/bash/
cp ~/spec-kit-devflows/commands/* .specify/commands/

# 4. Test workflows
/bugfix "test bug"
# ... verify it works
```

### Testing Changes

**Test every workflow** before submitting PR:

```bash
# Test /bugfix
/bugfix "test bug description"
# Verify: branch created, files generated, tasks make sense

# Test /modify
/modify 001 "test modification"
# Verify: nested under parent, impact analysis runs

# Test /refactor
/refactor "test refactor description"
# Verify: metrics template created

# Test /hotfix
/hotfix "test incident"
# Verify: expedited tasks, post-mortem reminder

# Test /deprecate
/deprecate 001 "test reason"
# Verify: 3-phase plan, dependency scan
```

**Test edge cases**:
- Feature with spaces in name
- Missing parent feature (for /modify)
- Non-existent feature number
- Invalid characters in description
- Empty repository

## Code Style

### Bash Scripts

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Script description here

# Exit on error
set -e

# Use absolute paths
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Clear error messages
error() {
    echo "ERROR: $1" >&2
    exit 1
}

# Validate inputs
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    error "Usage: $0 <required_param>"
fi
```

### Markdown

- Use ATX-style headers (`#` not `===`)
- Code blocks have language specified: ` ```bash `
- Lists use `-` for unordered, `1.` for ordered
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
- Add blank line after headers

### Templates

- Use placeholder syntax: `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}`
- Include comments explaining optional sections
- Provide examples inline
- Keep templates under 300 lines
